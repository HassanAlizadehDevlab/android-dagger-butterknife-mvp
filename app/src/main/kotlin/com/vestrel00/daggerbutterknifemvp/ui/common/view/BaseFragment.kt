/**
 * Abstract (Dialog)Fragment for all (Dialog)Fragments and child (Dialog)Fragments to extend.
 * This contains some boilerplate dependency injection code and activity [Context].
 *
 * **WHY EXTEND DialogFragment?**
 *
 * [DialogFragment]s are simple extensions of Fragments. DialogFragments can be shown as a
 * dialog floating above the current activity or be embedded into views like regular fragments.
 * Therefore, supporting both Fragments and DialogFragments for dependency injection can simply be
 * achieved by having the base fragment class (this) extend DialogFragment instead of Fragment.
 * We could have separate base classes for Fragments and DialogFragments but that would produce
 * duplicate code. See See https://github.com/vestrel00/android-dagger-butterknife-mvp/pull/64
 *
 * Note that as of Dagger 2.12, the abstract base framework type
 * [dagger.android.DaggerDialogFragment] has been introduced for subclassing if so desired.
 *
 * **DEPENDENCY INJECTION**
 *
 * We could extend [dagger.android.DaggerDialogFragment] so we can get the boilerplate dagger code
 * for free. However, we want to avoid inheritance (if possible and it is in this case) so that we
 * have to option to inherit from something else later on if needed.
 *
 * **VIEW BINDING**
 *
 * This fragment handles view bind and unbinding.

     * The property `childFragmentManager` cannot be declared here with that name as it results in
     * an 'accidental override' compile-time error. Kotlin automatically generates getters for
     * properties. In this case, Kotlin generates a method called `getChildFragmentManager()` for
     * the property `childFragmentManager`, which then conflicts with the Fragment's
     * `getChildFragmentManager()` method.
     *
     * There are workarounds to this;
     *
     * 1. Change the property name to something else such as `fragmentChildFragmentManager`.
     * 2. Rename the getter generated by Kotlin using @get:JvmName("fragmentChildFragmentManager")
     *
     * However, we will not be doing any of the above because subclasses would have to use our
     * custom getter/property instead of the builtin `childFragmentManager`, which may cause
     * confusion.
     *
     * The caveat to this is that we would need to use Robolectric in our tests in order to mock and
     * verify `FragmentManager` usages. For more details around testing `FragmentManager` usages,
     * see https://github.com/vestrel00/android-dagger-butterknife-mvp/pull/52.
